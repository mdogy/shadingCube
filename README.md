Javascript Canvas Experiments with a Rotating Shaded Cube

This is meant to teach some basic Javascript, such as use of the canvas, as well as some linear algebra,
and basic Lambertian, shading.

Initially played with processing js but latest version has a rotating shading cube with no dependencies. 

To Do:
Write scaffolding ...
A. from 0 to circle, line, quad and potentially triangle shapes on the canvas.
B. to create a rotated, static, square, vertices only.
C. to animate a rotating square, vertices only.
D. to animate a rotating square, vertices + edges.
E. to create a rotated cube, static, with vertices only.
F. to create a rotating cube, vertics only.
G. to create a rotating cube, vertices + edges.
H. to create a rotating cube, vertices + edges + faces (transparent).
I. to create a rotating cube, vertices + edges + faces, with occlusion using normals.
J. to create a rotating shaded cube, vertices + edges + faces, with occlusion using normal.
